# Bellabeat-Case-Study
This project delves into the analysis of smart device usage data to uncover patterns in non-Bellabeat smart device usage. The aim is to select a Bellabeat product and leverage these insights to provide recommendations to the marketing team.

This project involves data analysis using R.

## Dataset Used
The dataset comprises minute-level details from 30 users concerning physical activity, heart rate, and sleep obtained from Fitbit Fitness Trackers. This dataset is particularly valuable for deriving insights related to health and lifestyle. It is provided under the CC0 license and can be accessed via Mobius.
